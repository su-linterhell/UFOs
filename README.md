# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to take UFO data stored in a JS file and use that to create an interactive webpage. This webpage allows the user to search for UFO sightings throughout the US based on different criteria. 

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
The first step of this project was to create a webpage that could be searchable by 1 critieria, date. From there I built a working interactive webpage, but theere was more information that could be used to filter through the UFO sightings. The webpage was expanded to search by city, state, country or shape in addition to the date. This makes reading this table of UFO sightings much easier for users. Users may be interested in different criteria to search for recorded UFO sightings, such as city. If someone is curious if their city has any recorded UFO sightings, rather than searching by date, they can now easily do so. Once on the webpage, all a user has to do is fill in the information they are intersted in searching by, whether thats one or all 5 filters provided. Clicking "return" or "enter" after they type in their filter information, then gives them a table of UFO sightings specific to the criteria they are interested in.
